# Project QuickPolls

QuickPolls is a Django WebServer, that functions as a people gather, to vote in simple questions, quick and easy.

It functions in one principle: register your account, log in, enter a ongoing Poll, vote and leave a comment (opcional), and leave (if you want).

Or you can make your own Poll! Create its title, description, selection vote, and publish it! Everyone will be able to vote in it.

QuickPolls is an personal project, that will benefit me only in the educacional way. It is a Django project, to help me build
kwnowledge in the BackEnd way, as a FullStack developer.
